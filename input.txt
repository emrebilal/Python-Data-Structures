Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on building applications that learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without being programmed to do so. 
In data science, an algorithm is a sequence of statistical processing steps. 
In machine learning, algorithms are trained to find patterns and features in massive amounts of data in order to make decisions and predictions based on new data. 
The better the algorithm, the more accurate the decisions and predictions will become as it processes more data.
